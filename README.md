## Background of the Study
Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas, leading to wasted time, increased pollution, and economic losses.

## Problem Statement
- Predict traffic at intersections.
- Devise a traffic management plan by adjusting traffic signal timers.

## Introduction
In this project, we have utilized and compared various AI/ML models to predict traffic at road intersections and devised an efficient plan to manage signal timers.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing 48,120 observations of the number of vehicles each hour in four different lanes:
- DateTime
- Junction/Lane
- Vehicles
- ID

### Preprocessing
- The initial dataset is split into two separate datasets.
- Normalization is performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the square root of variance.
- Data is plotted to determine its distribution and relevance.

## Feature Engineering
Relevant features are extracted and new features are created:
1. **DateTime features**: Hour, DayOfWeek, Month, Year, Date
2. **Interaction Feature**: HourDayOfWeek
3. **Junction Feature**: Overall Traffic
4. **Temporal Feature**: Trend

## Algorithms/Methodology

### Linear Regression
Implemented from scratch to model the relationship between independent variables and the target variable.

### Random Forest
An ensemble learning method used for regression tasks, achieving an MSE of 0.2403.

### Gradient Boosting
Builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models. Utilized decision trees as base learners.

### XGBoost
An optimized implementation of gradient boosting, improving performance with regularization techniques and parallel processing.

### LSTM
A type of recurrent neural network designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Implemented for time series prediction involving vehicle traffic data.

## Findings
- Models were evaluated and compared based on their performance.
- LSTM and Random Forest models provided the best predictions without overfitting the data.

## Testing
- Models were tested on each junction.
- Evaluation metrics such as MSE were used to measure performance.

## Analysis
- Models were tested on hidden datasets to assess their real-life prediction capabilities.
- Inference showed that LSTM and Random Forest models performed well without overfitting.

## Traffic Management
An algorithm was devised to calculate the green time for signals at each lane, optimizing traffic flow based on various assumptions and real-life constraints.

## Conclusion
The models, especially LSTM and Random Forest, provided reliable predictions and can be utilized for real-life traffic management by adjusting traffic signal timers.

## Next Steps
Future work includes extending the traffic prediction model to real-life scenarios and implementing the approach on a directed weighted graph to optimize traffic signal timing.
